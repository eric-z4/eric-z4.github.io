## Introduction

Questions are important. They usually present an opportunity for someone to discuss something with another person or a group. This prompt for discussion may lead to a conclusive answer(s) (or more questions), but it depends on what is being asked. In the case of software engineers, there are numerous questions that are asked on forums, like Stack Overflow, and not every user has the time to answer all of them. A simple "how do I do X thing with Y?" will either be met with "rtfm (read the flippin manual)" or "stfw (search the fudging web)" replies, or simply be ignored. To ensure questions are worthy to be answered, they have to be relevant, explicit, and informed.
