Back when I was in high school, I attended some programming classes that taught basic programming skills, front-end web development, and a little bit of back-end development. One of the first programming languages I ever learned was Javascript, and it was what got me hooked onto programming in general. During my time in high school, I wanted to explore other programming languages such as Python, Java, and C#. As a result, I remember trying to learn C#, but I got confused by the differences in syntax of C# compared to Javascript. One of the more obvious differences being that variables require a data type (e.g. int, char, etc.) to be specified rather than just using "var" or "let."

To my younger self, Python, Java, and C# was almost like learning a second langauge (as in the languages we use to speak and write with). Eventually, I decided to study about the other programming languages as if I never programmed before; what is a variable? What is a function/method? How do you make a loop? These were a handful of questions I asked myself that made me realize that these programming languages, Javascript included, are not so different. Even if they are written differently, they can be used to more or less achieve the same outcome like printing out "Hello World!"

Of course, there are still some variation between languages. Most notably, ES6 (ECMAScript), the most recent version of Javascript, introduces destructuring, which is a new syntax that I have only discovered a few days before writing this essay.
