## Introduction

If you ever took the time to have a closer look at things, you will notice that our roofs, keyboards, bags, and other such things typically follow patterns. Besides covering the tops of houses, there are some common designs such as gable roofs, shed roofs, flat roofs, and so on; keyboards usually follow the QWERTY, QWERTZ, or AZERTY layout; and bags have various designs for people to carry things in a certain way (e.g. backpacks, purses, duffel bags, etc.).
