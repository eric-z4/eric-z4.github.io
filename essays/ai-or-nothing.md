## Introduction

AI technology has been rapidly improving its capabilities in recent years. For instance, AI systems like [DALL-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2) can generate various images based on what the user tells it to make. In software engineering, AI, such as [GitHub Copilot](https://openai.com/dall-e-2) and [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), have been used to help with software development, debugging, and even learning programming concepts. 

## My (Lack of) Experience with AI

I have seen the versatility and potential of AI, but I have never used one myself. Whether for an assignment that allowed it or for my projects, I was okay with working on these things without an AI. In most cases, I was able to find or come up with solutions to problems like "Why is my [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) application giving an error stating it cannot find the module 'fibers/future' when starting up?" Admittedly, there was not a concrete solution for this strange error when I looked at some forums. I tried "turning it off and on again," downloading that "fibers/future" module into my application, and updating Windows, which did not solve the issue. I ended up looking through my application's files and found that the fibers module existed in one of the two files that store modules. I copied that module into the other file, and my Meteor application was able to start up.

Would AI have helped me solve my problem faster? I can not say for sure. An AI could have pinpointed what was wrong with my application, but it could have also been as helpful as the forums I went through. Regardless, I think AI could be a faster alternative to browsing through documents and forums, as it will likely return an answer in a shorter time.

## The Impact of AI

Despite my experience, I can say that AI certainly has its uses in practical applications. One notable example is (the development of a robot with an AI that could extract oxygen from water on Mars)[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/a-robotic-ai-chemist-could-make-oxygen-on-mars-180983268/]. The AI can identify elements in rock samples to create a catalyst that can break down water into oxygen. As mentioned in the article, the robot's algorithm was able to determine "3.7 million possible molecules to break down water and form oxygen" out of five meteorites in a few weeks. A process that would have taken approximately 2,000 years for a human to determine.

## Conclusion

While I can not give any personal anecdotes about AI, there is a lot of potential for the future utilization of AI. I think AI should be explored and pushed further, similar to how computers were used to solve complicated problems.
