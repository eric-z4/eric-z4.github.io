These were taught in the context of designing a web application, leading up to a [web app project I worked on with a group](https://rainbows-gallery.github.io/) using the [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) web framework. However, these software engineering concepts apply to much more than just web app development. 

## A Suitable Environment

An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software tool that provides many helpful features for programming and developing software. They may include an autocomplete for faster coding, a built-in file browser for quick access to files, and a syntax highlighter to check for mistakes in writing code. There are many different development environments like [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [Eclipse](https://eclipseide.org/), and [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/). While IDEs can be complicated, they allow software engineers to develop and edit larger software systems. For instance, something as simple as renaming a variable can be tedious since there could be multiple references to that variable hidden within a sea of code. IntelliJ Idea offers several ways of dealing with this: selecting the variable will highlight
