## Introduction

In my software engineering class, I learned about various concepts such as development environments, user interface frameworks, and Agile project management. These were taught in the context of designing a web application, leading up to a [web app project I worked on with a group](https://rainbows-gallery.github.io/) using the [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) web framework. However, these software engineering concepts apply to much more than just web app development. 

## A Suitable Environment

An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software tool that provides many helpful features for programming and developing software. They may include an autocomplete for faster coding, a built-in file browser for quick access to files, and a syntax highlighter to check for mistakes in writing code. There are many different development environments like [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [Eclipse](https://eclipseide.org/), and [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/). While IDEs can be complicated, they allow software engineers to develop and edit larger software systems. For instance, something as simple as renaming a variable can be tedious since there could be multiple references to that variable hidden within a sea of code. IntelliJ Idea offers several ways of dealing with this: selecting the variable will [highlight](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Navigation_and_Search__Finding_Usages__Highlighting_Usages_in_File.html) other places it is used; inputting the variable into the [find feature](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/finding-and-replacing-text-in-file.html#findInSelection) will also mark where they are; and using the [rename refactoring](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/rename-refactorings.html) (renaming without altering functionality) option will automatically change every instance of said variable.

## Choosing Frameworks

A framework refers to a library that contains objects and utilities typically for some aspect of software development. To elaborate from before, Meteor is a web application framework that includes features like user accounts, database functions, and the ability to run the app locally. Besides Meteor, there are also [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), which are mobile app frameworks. They both have various user interface components (e.g. buttons, text fields, etc.), functions for detecting taps on a touchscreen, and other uses that I have not yet explored.
