<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you have never heard of the term “spaghetti code,” it refers to code that is difficult to understand due to not having a defined structure or way of writing. It can be confusing and frustrating for people to read, almost like an essay with no headers, transitions, or punctuation. To avoid this problem, software engineers usually have coding standards that specify the rules and guidelines for writing code. For instance, a standard for writing in JavaScript may suggest that strings should have single quotation marks rather than double quotation marks (i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'example of string'</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"example of string"</code>). There are possibly many different coding standards, but they all serve to keep code organized and consistent.</p>

<h2 id="why-would-i-bother-with-coding-standards-if-i-am-just-coding-for-myself">Why would I bother with coding standards if I am just coding for myself?</h2>

<p>Other than making code more legible, following coding standards can provide advantages such as practicing good coding habits. Using the <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript">AirBnB JavaScript Style Guide</a> as an example, one of the things that the guide recommends is to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var</code> for all references (<a href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#references">Link to that section in the guide</a>). As mentioned in the style guide, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> prevents the variable from being reassigned intentionally or mistakenly when coding. If the variable’s value must change, it suggests using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">let</code> instead.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, the coding standards outlined in the style guide are not the only way to write JavaScript. You could follow coding standards from multiple guides, assuming they pertain to the same programming language. Alternatively, you could even make up your own rules for writing code. However, coding standards are essential when collaborating with other software engineers since they ensure a “common look.” If one collaborator decides to check someone else’s code for bugs, they are able to easily understand where things are located and what they do.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Organization is crucial, especially with larger and more complicated projects. Coding standards can help establish a pattern for software engineers to follow, even if there are many interrelated variables and functions. While coding standards are not required to make working programs, they will likely make code easier to read and understand overall.</p>
