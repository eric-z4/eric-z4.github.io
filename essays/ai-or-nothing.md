## Introduction

AI technology has been rapidly improving its capabilities in recent years. For instance, AI systems like [DALL-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2) can generate various images based on what the user tells it to make. In software engineering, AI, such as [GitHub Copilot](https://openai.com/dall-e-2) and [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), have been used to help with software development, debugging, and even learning programming concepts. 

## My (Lack of) Experience with AI

I have seen the versatility and potential of AI, but I have never used one myself. Whether for an assignment that allowed it or for my projects, I was okay with working on these things without an AI. In most cases, I was able to find or come up with solutions to problems like "Why is my [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) application giving an error stating it cannot find the module 'fibers/future' when starting up?" Admittedly, there was not a concrete solution for this strange error when I looked at some forums. I tried "turning it off and on again," downloading that "fibers/future" module into my application, and updating Windows, which did not solve the issue. I ended up looking through my application's files and found that the fibers module existed in one of the two files that store modules. I copied that module into the other file, and my Meteor application was able to start up.

Would AI have helped me solve my problem faster? I can not say for sure. An AI could have pinpointed what was wrong with my application, but it could have also been as helpful as the forums I went through.

## The Impact of AI

Despite my experience, I can say that AI certainly has its uses in practical applications, as demonstrated by GitHub Copilot.
