<p>I have always been interested in creating things, whether I draw with a pencil or work with a computer. The process of using an assortment of tools and putting together a tangible idea will never be unsatisfying to me. Likewise, there is that feeling of improvement where I can look back on previous works and see my progress. Programming and drawing are what I mainly use as a creative outlet, and I have also dabbled in electronics and video editing. While I worked on my small projects, I found that learning about the various tools and techniques that experts utilize has taught me to experiment with what I know.</p>

<p>Software engineering fits into my broad interest in creating stuff. There is a multitude of tools, frameworks, and libraries that provide numerous features. For instance, React is a library for JavaScript that allows developers to create interactive user interfaces for websites and applications. I have only tried out a handful of libraries (i.e. p5js and Node.js), so I am open to learning about things I could include in my projects.</p>

<p>As of writing this essay, I am taking a software engineering course - ICS 314. Other than studying web development, I also want to improve my collaboration skills since I rarely worked in groups for past projects. In the future, I hope that not only can I build up my programming skills but also work in a team to create projects better than what I can achieve on my own.</p>
